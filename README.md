# PyBer_Analysis

## Project Overview
As a Data Analyst at Pyber, I was asked to perform and exploratory analysis on a large dataset to help improve the access of ride-sharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods. To help me tell a complete story about the data, I created different types of visualizations that will show the relationship between the type opf city, and the numbers of drivers and rides as well as the percentage of total fares, drivers and rides by type of city.

## Resources
- Data source: city_data.csv and ride_data.csv

## Results
I created a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type, see image below for reference:

Looking at the DataFrame, we can see that the type of city with the most drivers and number of rides are the urban cities. Following it, the suburban cities and finally there are the rural cities. 

Because rural cities have a lower number of drivers and rides, we see that the average fare percentage for both rides and drivers is higher than for other types of cities.

## Summary

Based on the results, my recommendations are:

- Pyber should increase the number of drivers in rural cities, so that the number of rides could rise and therefore lower the fare per ride. Lower fares will contributed pularity of share-riding in this type of city.

- Since the number of drivers in urban cities is too high compared to the number of drivers in suburban cities, we could contemplate switching some of them to serve in suburban cities.

- To complement the suggestion above, PyBer should promote more the "share-ride" idea in order that less drivers will be needed if people agreed to share more rides with third parties. Sharing a ride could help them split the fare and in the end each of the parties will pay less than paying the whole fare by themselves.
